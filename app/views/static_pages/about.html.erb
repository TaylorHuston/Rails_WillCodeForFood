    <p>Tired of searching through hundreds of job postings just to find ones for 'junior' candidates?</p>
    <p>Tired of seeing that most of those positions for 'junior' candidates want 3-5 years of experience in 4 different stacks, some of which
    aren't even 3 years old?</p>
    <p>Well so was I. So after another particularly frustrating evening of job hunting, I came up with the idea for this site. Grabbed the domain
    and got to work. The 1.0 version of this site was just a quick thing I threw up using WordPress. This is the 2.0 version that I've built
    from scratch using Rails. It's a little barebones right now, but I plan to keep working on and expanding it every chance I get!</p>
